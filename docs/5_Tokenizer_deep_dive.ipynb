    "\n",
    "#### 1. Substring Enumeration and Counting\n",
    "\n",

It slides a window of every possible length (from 1 up to `max_token_len`) across the text and counts the occurrences of every single \"legal\" substring. A substring is legal if it respects Unicode boundaries and doesn't improperly split protected entities like URLs (as determined by `utils.is_legal_span`).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "* `substr_count`: A frequency count of every valid substring found in the text.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Candidate Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw `substr_count` contains a massive number of substrings, many of which are junk or noise. This step acts as a filter, creating a cleaner set of `_potential_tokens` by applying several heuristic rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Frequency:** Must appear at least `min_freq` times.\n",
    "* **Noise:** Filters out tokens that are likely wiki-formatting (`''`, `==`), redirect commands, or just punctuation.\n",
    "* **Structure:** Filters out tokens with too many internal spaces or strange mixtures of scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dramatically reduces the number of candidates the algorithm needs to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Indexing Occurrences\n",
    "\n",
    "For speed, the algorithm needs to be able to quickly find every location a potential token appears. This step builds an index (a dictionary called `_token_occurrences`) that maps each potential token to a list of all its starting positions in the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Calculating Statistical Costs (The Math) 🧠\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the heart of the function. For every potential token, we calculate two scores that form its \"base cost.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Token Rarity: The Negative Log-Likelihood Cost (`_nll`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This score measures how rare a token is, conditioned on its length. The core idea is that more frequent tokens should have a lower cost. We use the negative log-likelihood, which is a standard way to turn probabilities into costs in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we calculate the smoothed probability of a token t of length L:\n",
    "$$P(t|L)=\\frac{\\texttt{count}(t) + \\alpha_{\\texttt{len}}}{\\left(\\sum_{t'\\; \\text{where}\\; \\texttt{len}(t')=L}\\;\\texttt{count}(t')\\right) + \\alpha_{\\texttt{len}}\\cdot N_L} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "* $\\texttt{count}(t)$ is the frequency of our specific token $t$.\n",
    "* The sum in the denominator is the total count of all tokens that have the same length L.\n",
    "* $\\alpha_{\\texttt{len}}$ is a smoothing constant (additive or Laplace smoothing) to prevent probabilities of zero for unseen tokens.\n",
    "* $N_L$ is the number of unique token types of length L.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final cost is the negative log of this probability. Tokens that are common for their length will have a high probability and thus a low cost.\n",
    "$$ \\text{cost}_{\\text{NLL}}(t) = −\\log(P(t∣L))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Token Cohesion: The PMI-like Penalty (`_pmi_pen`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This score measures how \"gluey\" or cohesive a token's characters are. It answers the question: \"Do these characters appear together more often than we'd expect by chance?\" A high cohesion score suggests the string is a meaningful unit (like \"ing\") rather than a random sequence of letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is based on **Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)**. The formula is:\n",
    "$$\\text{PMI-score}(t) =\\log\\left(\\frac{P(t|L)}{\\prod^L_{i=1}P(c_i)}\\right) $$\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "* $P(t∣L)$ is the length-conditioned probability we just calculated above.\n",
    "* $P(c_i)$ is the probability of the i-th character in the token, derived from the initial `char_count`.\n",
    "* The product $\\prod P(c_i)$ represents the probability of seeing that sequence of characters if they were all statistically independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the score is high, it means the numerator is much larger than the denominator—the token appears far more frequently than chance would suggest, making it a cohesive unit. The final `_pmi_pen` is the **negative** of this score, so that highly cohesive tokens get a **cost reduction (a reward)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Initializing the Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "The tokenizer needs a starting vocabulary. This step simply initializes the vocabulary with all single characters seen in the corpus. This provides a crucial fallback: if no multi-character tokens can be formed, the system can always represent the text as a sequence of individual characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: How would this vocabulary handle large amounts of unique unicode symbols? ⭐\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Training the Morphology Encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, using the collected statistics (`_potential_tokens` and `_token_occurrences`), the function trains the `MorphologyEncoder`. This component learns the sub-word patterns (common prefixes, suffixes, and character n-grams) of each language. Its math is self-contained (involving matrix factorization of a PPMI matrix), but it relies on the data prepared in the preceding steps to do its job."

    "\n",
    "The process unfolds in six key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Determine Primary Language for Each Token\n",
    "\n",
    "A token (especially a name or a loanword) might appear in texts from multiple languages. This initial step simply assigns each token to a single, primary language based on where it appears most frequently. This ensures that a token like \"start\" is analyzed using English morphology rules, even if it appears once in a German text.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Build the Feature Matrix $X$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the foundational step where we convert raw text into a numerical matrix. The matrix X represents the relationship between tokens and their morphological features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Rows:** Each row corresponds to a unique token t from the corpus.\n",
    "* **Columns:** Each column corresponds to a unique feature f. Features are things like character bigrams (`'th'`, `'ng'`), trigrams (`'ing'`), and known affixes (`'$suf:ing'`).\n",
    "* **Values:** The cell $X_{tf}$ contains an integer count of how many times feature $f$ appears in token $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for the token `'running'`, the row would have non-zero values in the columns corresponding to features like `'ru'`, `'un'`, `'nn'`, `'ni'`, `'in'`, `'ng'`, `'run'`, `'unn'`, `'nni'`, `'nin'`, `'ing'`, and `'$suf:ing'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Calculate the Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (PPMI) Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Using raw counts ($X$) is not ideal because common features (like the character `'e'`) aren't very informative. We want to find features that are surprisingly common for a given token. This is what **Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)** measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for PMI between a token t and a feature f is:\n",
    "$$\\text{PMI}(t,f)=\\log_2\\left(\\frac{P(t,f)}{P(t)P(f)}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break this down:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $P(t,f)$: The joint probability of seeing the token $t$ and the feature $f$ together. In the code, this is calculated as `P_xy`, where each cell is the count from $X$ divided by the total sum of all counts in $X$.\n",
    "* $P(t)$: The marginal probability of seeing token $t$. This is the sum of row $t$ in $X$ divided by the total sum (`P_x`).\n",
    "* $P(f)$: The marginal probability of seeing feature $f$. This is the sum of column $f$ in $X$ divided by the total sum (`P_y`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ratio $\\frac{P(t,f)}{P(t)P(f)}$ tells us how much more likely the feature and token are to co-occur than if they were independent. A large ratio means the feature is highly indicative of that token.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code then computes **Positive PMI (PPMI)** by taking `max(0, PMI)`. This discards negative associations (where features co-occur less than chance), as they are often noisy and not useful for this task. The result is a matrix `PPMI` of the same shape as $X$, but with values that represent feature informativeness rather than raw counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Factorize the PPMI Matrix to Get Vectors (The Math)\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have a large, sparse `PPMI` matrix. Our goal is to create short, dense vectors (embeddings) for each token. This is a dimensionality reduction problem. The code uses **Eigendecomposition**, a powerful technique from linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Create a Token-Token Similarity Matrix ($G$):** The code first computes $G=PPMI\\times PPMI^T$, $G=(G+G^T)\\cdot 0.5$. This results in a square matrix where each cell $G_{ij}$ represents the similarity between token $i$ and token $j$. If two tokens share many of the same informative features, their corresponding value in $G$ will be high. This is known as a Gram matrix.\n",
    "* **Eigendecomposition:** The code then performs eigendecomposition on G. This breaks the matrix down into its constituent eigenvalues and eigenvectors: $G=Q\\Lambda Q^{−1}$\n",
    "* **Eigenvectors ($Q$):** These are the principal components of the matrix. They represent the fundamental directions of variation in the data—in this case, the most important axes of morphological similarity.\n",
    "* **Eigenvalues ($\\Lambda$):** These are scalar values that indicate how much variance is explained by each eigenvector. A large eigenvalue means its corresponding eigenvector is very important.\n",
    "* **Construct the Embedding Matrix ($V$):** We don't need all the eigenvectors, only the most important ones. The code selects the top `k` eigenvectors corresponding to the `k` largest eigenvalues. The final token embedding for each token is constructed by taking its corresponding row from the top `k` eigenvectors, and scaling each component by the square root of its associated eigenvalue. This is a standard method that yields embeddings where the squared distance between vectors approximates the similarity relationship in the original data.\n",
    "* **Normalization:** Finally, each vector in $V$ is normalized to have a unit length of 1. This is crucial because it allows us to use the dot product as a direct measure of **cosine similarity**. When comparing two unit vectors, their dot product is exactly the cosine of the angle between them, providing a pure measure of similarity irrespective of vector magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Store Learned Vectors and Language Prototypes\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the factorization is stored:\n",
    "* `token_vec`: A dictionary mapping each token string to its learned dense vector (a row from $V$).\n",
    "* `lang_proto`: A dictionary mapping each language to a \"prototype\" vector. This prototype is calculated by **averaging the vectors of all tokens** belonging to that language. It represents the morphological center-of-gravity for that language in the learned vector space.\n",

    "### ScalableTokenizer.train - Loop phase\n",
    "The training loop continuously alternates between two main phases: the **Primal Step** (solving the problem with the current vocabulary) and the **Pricing Step** (finding new, better vocabulary to add).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 1: The Primal Step - Finding the Best Path with `_dp_decode` 🗺️**\n",
    "\n",
    "In each iteration, the first thing we must do is find the best possible way to tokenize the entire corpus using our **current** vocabulary. This is what `_dp_decode` does.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function treats tokenization as finding the \"shortest path\" through the text. Imagine the text as a graph where each character is a node. A potential token is an arc or \"road\" connecting the character node at its start to the node at its end. Each road has a toll, which is its cost. The goal is to find the sequence of roads from the beginning to the end with the lowest total toll.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classic problem solved efficiently using **Dynamic Programming**, specifically the **Viterbi algorithm**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Logic and the Math**\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm builds a table, `dp`, where $dp[t,k]$ stores the minimum possible cost to segment the text up to character position $t$, with the very last token belonging to class $k$ (e.g., \"lower\", \"InitCap\", etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "It calculates this by iterating through each position $t$ in the text and looking backward for all possible split points $i$. The core recurrence relation is:\n",
    "$$dp[t,j]=\\min_{i,k}(dp[i,k]+\\text{cost}(\\text{text}[i:t]))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "* `text[i:t]` is the new token candidate.\n",
    "* $j$ is the class of this new token.\n",
    "* We find the minimum cost by trying all possible previous split points $i$ and all previous token classes $k$.\n",
    "* The `cost` term is a combination of the token's base statistical cost (`_base_token_cost`) and all other linguistic feature costs (`additive_cost`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important output of this step is the array `dp_min`. This array, `all_dp_min` in the `train` function, stores the minimum cost to reach **every character position** in the text. $dp_{\\text{min}}[t]$ is the cost of the optimal tokenization from the start of the string up to character $t$. This array is the crucial input for the next phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 2: The Pricing Step - Finding Shortcuts with `_find_best_new_tokens_batch` 💰**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know the cost of the \"best path\" using our current roads (vocabulary), we can search for potential shortcuts. This is the \"pricing\" or \"column generation\" step. We evaluate every potential token that is **not** currently in our vocabulary and calculate its **Reduced Cost**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Reduced Cost is the \"profitability\" of adding a new token. It answers the question: \"By how much would the total tokenization cost decrease if we added this new token to our vocabulary?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Logic and the Math**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a candidate token tok that spans from start to end in the text, we can calculate the potential savings.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cost of the Old Path:** The cost to get from the beginning to position `end` using the current vocabulary is already known: it's $dp_{\\text{min}}[end]$.\n",
    "2. **Cost of the New Path:** If we were allowed to use our new token `tok`, the cost to get to `end` would be the cost of the best path to `start`, plus the cost of our new token itself. This is: $dp_{\\text{min}}[\\text{start}]+\\text{cost}(\\text{tok})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Reduced Cost (RC)** is the difference between these two:\n",
    "$$\\text{RC}(\\text{tok})=(dp_{\\text{min}}[\\text{start}]+\\text{cost}(\\text{tok}))−dp_{\\text{min}}[\\text{end}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Reduced Cost is **negative**, it means the new path is cheaper than the old path. This token is a valuable \"shortcut\" that reduces the total segmentation cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `_find_best_new_tokens_batch` function iterates through every occurrence of every potential token, calculates its RC, and sums up the total potential savings for each unique token across the entire corpus. It then sorts them and returns the `top_k` tokens with the most negative total RC—these are the most valuable new \"expressways\" to build.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Putting It Together: The Loop**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `train` function simply repeats these two steps:\n",
    "1. `_dp_decode` **(Primal):** Calculate the optimal paths and costs (`dp_min`) for the whole corpus with the current vocabulary.\n",
    "2. `_find_best_new_tokens_batch` **(Pricing):** Use the `dp_min` costs to find the new tokens with the most negative Reduced Cost.\n",
    "3. **Update:** Add these new, high-value tokens to the vocabulary.\n",
    "4. **Repeat:** Continue this cycle until no new tokens with a significantly negative RC can be found, at which point the vocabulary has converged to an optimal state."
