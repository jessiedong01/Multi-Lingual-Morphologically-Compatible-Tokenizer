\subsection{Word-Level Boundary Agreement on Morphological Examples}
Universal Segmentations (UniSegments) \citep{UniSeg2023} is a collection of lexical resources that capture morphological segmentations harmonized into a cross-linguistically consistent annotation scheme for many languages. Each dataset stores words and their morphological segmentations in tab-separated columns, along with information about the word, its segmented units, part-of-speech category, and morpheme type. The current public version of UniSegments includes 38 harmonized datasets covering 30 languages. We use the gold-standard word segmentations from this database as our baseline for evaluating morphological tokenization accuracy.
